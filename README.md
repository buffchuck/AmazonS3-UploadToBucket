# AmazonS3-UploadToBucket
Upload to AWS S3 bucket

Simple one class Java program meant to demonstrate how one can use the AWS Java SDK to upload objects to an already created AWS S3 bucket.
This code is available at Amazon AWS website. Only slight tweaks here just to prove out some of the AWS concepts surrounding S3 buckets.
